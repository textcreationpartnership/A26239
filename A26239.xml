            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE two incloſed Relations are ſent me from an Eminent Divine, now at the <hi>Hague,</hi> you will do well to make them publick: The poyſoning Buſineſs I doubt not but was contriv'd by a ſort of Men that in all Ages ſtick at nothing to carry on their Bloody Religion.</p>

               <head>An Account of a Deſign of poiſoning the PRINCE OF <hi>ORANGE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is a Man of <hi>Lunenburg Wolfenbuttel,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen in Debt in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> upon his Father's Death, his Brother taking no Care of him, was put in Priſon and brought extream low; yet he was brought out by the means of a Friend: And ſoon after a Man who pretended to know him, and to have ſeen him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29986:2"/>(though the <hi>German</hi> believes he never ſaw him) ſeem'd to take pitty on him, ſeeing him in a Coffee-Houſe, and gave him a Ducatoon, and promiſed he ſhould never want; ſo he entred into a great familiarity with him, but would never let him know where he lodged, only he gave him Appointments in Coffee-Houſes and Taverns, and fed him from time to time with Mony: At laſt, after ſome weeks, he drew him into a ſecret Walk in the Grounds that are not yet built, and ask'd him if he had a Heart to do a bold Thing? The <hi>German</hi> ſaid he had, if it were not ſuch a Thing as might bring him to a Scaffold. The other ſaid, There was no Danger, only it would require a little hardineſs. Then he ask'd an Oath of the <hi>German,</hi> That he would either do that which he was to propoſe to him, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently go out of the Country. The <hi>German</hi> ſaid, He could not go out of the Country, for he had no Mony: And then he gave him eight Ducats in Gold, and then he ſwore the Oath: So the other propoſed to him the poiſoning the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> that ſtartled him, but apprehending he ſhould be killed if he refuſed it, he undertook it. The other told him, That in the laſt Age Men had tried Stabbing or Shooting, but theſe were dangerous Things, Poiſoning was a ſafe and ſure way: He added, That he ſhould have 3000 Piſtols in hand, and a Fortune beſides. The <hi>German</hi> ask'd, From whom? The other, who called himſelf <hi>Corne,</hi> and ſpoke French like a Stranger, but the <hi>German</hi> cannot judg what Nation he was of; the other, I ſay, ſaid to to him, That if he had the Mony, he was not concern'd know from whence it came. In ſhort, he made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>German,</hi> giving him a Quill with a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it, carefully ſtop'd, and told him, that he (the <hi>German</hi>) lodged in the Houſe of an inconſiderable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29986:3"/>Man, of whom no regard would be had; and if he would cut the Quill, ſo that one drop of the Liquor fell into any thing that his Landlord was to drink, he would be certainly dead before to Morrow; and if he would begin with him, one ſhould come to him to ſuch a place to Morrow, having a white Feather in his Hat, who ſhould deliver him 1500 Piſtols, and inſtruct him how to manage the Poiſoning the Prince, which he ſhould find would be eaſy and ſafe; then upon his going on he ſhould have the reſt of the Mony. The <hi>German</hi> went Home, but was ſtruck with Horror, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep that part of his Oath of going out of the Country; yet he ſhew'd another his Gold, and told him of his going Home: But from <hi>Oſnaburgh</hi> he writ to one about the Prince; this hapned in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> laſt. So he was deſired to come back, which he did, and the Matter being brought into the Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> upon an Oath of Secreſy, Mr. <hi>Halewyn</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Dort,</hi> and another, were ſent with him to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam;</hi> they found many collateral Confirmations of part of his Story, but no ſuch Man could be ſeen in all the Places where he had met with him formerly; the <hi>German</hi> came to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and being in the Fair, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Shews, and a <hi>Dane</hi> with him, as they came out in a huge Crowd, the <hi>German</hi> complain'd that one ſtruck him on the Breaſt with a Battoon: But this was not minded till they were quite out, and he found one had ſtruck at him, as it ſeems, with a <hi>Stilletto</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the left Pap, his Cloak and Coat were cut, and the Wound proved but a ſlight Scratch; the Quill with the Poiſon in it ſealed, is in the Court. It ſeems, a <hi>German</hi> was thought a fit Tool, being of a Nation that would not be eaſily ſuſpected; and the putting it on a <hi>Lutheran</hi> would have been thought a Maſter-piece. I give you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29986:4"/>this Account, which I will Anſwer for, to ſatisfy ſome of your Friends, both Here and in <hi>England,</hi> who will perhaps deſire to know the Certainty of this Matter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ON the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1665, when his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> took Poſſeſſion of that Principality, and whilſt his Deputy Mr. <hi>Ziule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> was taking the Oath of Allegiance of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Prince's Name, which was done in the Fields, in the Encloſure of the old Roman Cirque that yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; over the Chair of State that was ſet there for the Prince, a Crown of Light appear'd in the Air, and hover'd over the Chair above an hour: And now this Year, 1688, the ſame day of the Month, in the ſame place, the like Crown appear'd and continued there three hours, all the People of <hi>Orange</hi> looking on; all the difference between this Years Crown, and that of 1665, being, that this had an Edg of Red about it. This is writ from <hi>Orange</hi> by an old Profeſſor of Phyſick, that is paſt ſixty, and not apt to take things upon truſt; he writes that he himſelf, as well as all the Town, look'd on it for above two hours with great admiration of that ſtrange Meteor. An account of that ſtrange Meteor in 1665. is related by <hi>Aitrema</hi> in his <hi>5th</hi> Tome, <hi>fol.</hi> 595. well atteſted, and he is a good Author.</p>
